Nguoi yeu oi anh se yeu va yeu moi em thoi!
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
I need you! Baby I'm not a monster!
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Nguoi yeu oi yeu minh anh duoc khong
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Xin hay la em cua ngay hom qua Uh huh uh huh
My missionaries in a foreign field
I wonder how, I wonder why
For some reason I can't explain
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky!
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree!Never an honest word

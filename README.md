# Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (C)

Here are my very first programs I've made since being an IT student. I don't really like C, but I have to tackle with this languague because my university's study program requires me 
to master this programing language at an intermediate level, so that's why you can see this repository on my GitHub profile ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„. There're still plenty of my codes here not really optimized or easy to get crashed when being executed, so I'm really happy to receive everyone's feedbacks and comments so that I can make my codes better.

One more last word, Thank you so much for your time visiting my basic DS&A repository!!!

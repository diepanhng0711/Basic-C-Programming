# Basic-C-Programming
[IT3230] - Basic C Programming

Here are my very first programs i've made since being an IT student. I don't really like C, but I have to deal with this languague because my university's study program requires me 
to master this programing language. There are still many things i've not done well here and I'm glad to receive everyone's comments so that i will improve those things in the 
future.
